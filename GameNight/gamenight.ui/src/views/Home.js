          board games your group will play ahead of time. This means more time for gaming!</p>

          <p>First youâ€™ll need to create a group and invite your friends, or join a group that
          someone else has already made.</p>

          <p>Next you should start adding games that you own to your GameNight game
          collection. This makes it easy to find and choose games to play on your next game
          night!</p>

          <p>Then you can start planning your next game night with your group! Have fun!</p></>
